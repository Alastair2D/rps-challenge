## Goals
- Classes are designed around the principles of Delegation & Single Responsibility.  The Game class delegates state and behaviour of player-related information to the Player class.  
- Only the Game class is instantiated in the controller, separating concerns to make this web-app a more modular program.

## Testing
- This program was built test-first using RSpec and Capybara to allow the user stories to be feature-tested.
- As with all good OOP testing, all unit tests have been isolated using doubles, mocks, stubs & spies.

## Task
Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!  The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.  Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web fulfilling the following requirements.

## User Stories
```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Hints on functionality
- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

## Bonus level 1: Multiplayer
Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other
